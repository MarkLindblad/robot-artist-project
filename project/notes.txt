7 angles:
0.0, -0.1, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.17, 3.14

first angle is base rotation, length position
second, fourth, sixth angles are lengthwise rotation axes
decreasing second angle moves up
increasing fourth angle moves down
decreasing sixth angle moves up
sixth angle default is pi/2 (1.57)
seventh angle is end effector rotation, set to pi/2 is fine

third, fifth angles are unneeded (always leave at 0.0)
